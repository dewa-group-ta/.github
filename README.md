# Dewa Team - KoTA 106
### *Where deadlines fear us (but we fear the examiners more).*


A student group powered by **teamwork**, **innovation**, and **pure academic survival instincts**.

We operate in the narrow space between **genius** and **chaos**, driven by caffeine, mild panic, and the sincere belief that deadlines are merely *suggestions*. Our workflow includes spontaneous brainstorming rituals, emergency idea rescues at unreasonable hours, and the occasional technical miracle that we ourselves cannot explain.

Despite confusion, overthinking, and deeply questionable sleep schedules, we consistently manage to turn academic disasters into functioning projects usually moments before the submission portal closes.

## Mission

To survive each semester while producing software that:
- Works (ideally)
- Looks professional (from a distance)
- Impresses lecturers (or at least reduces their disappointment)
- Does not crash during the final presentation

---

## Tech Stack

We use anything that:
- Compiles
- Runs
- Refuses to run but we force it
- Works only on our machines

Common tools include:
`JavaScript`, `Python`, `PHP`, `SQL`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and strategic improvisation.

## Research Method
# TrYyy...  
## CRYyyyy...  
### try again (we guess).  
#### pretending everything is under control.  
##### submit before it explodes.

## Special Thanks

To our lecturers, for providing structure.  
To deadlines, for providing urgency of a… different kind.

## Final Note

If you find bugs, remember:  
**They’re not bugs! Just unexpected features shaped by academic survival.**
